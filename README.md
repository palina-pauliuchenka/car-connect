## Overview

### Description

An android application that helps students to find Carpool to get to the campus and back.

#### Problem Statement
College students often experience significant financial hardship and face significant student loan debt after graduation. For the 85% of students that commute to campus, these financial challenges are advanced by the rising cost of transportation, gas, vehicle maintenance, parking and public transportation fares. These key factors highlight a need for affordable, student-focused car sharing platform. Along with reducing travel expenses, commuting students miss out on the possibilities to engage in on campus events or build connections with classmates. A reliable carpooling solution could provide more opportunities for commuting students to build connections. It also offers a safer commuting option, especially for those traveling late at night. Therefore, students need a carpooling service that is affordable, promotes community, and is designed with safety and convenience in mind.

#### High Level Vision
Our platform, CarConnect, addresses the financial and social challenges faced by commuting college students by providing a secure, affordable, and practical carpooling solution. Through CarConnect, students can connect with peers in nearby locations, facilitating organized and reliable shared transportation options. This approach reduces individual transportation costs and supports safer commuting, especially during late hours. CarConnect is dedicated to enhancing accessibility and building a supportive campus community, where students can experience a shared journey that fosters both safety and connection.
