## Overview

### Description

An android application that helps students to find Carpool to get to the campus and back.

#### Problem Statement
College students often experience significant financial hardship and face significant student loan debt after graduation. For the 85% of students that commute to campus, these financial challenges are advanced by the rising cost of transportation, gas, vehicle maintenance, parking and public transportation fares. These key factors highlight a need for affordable, student-focused car sharing platform. Along with reducing travel expenses, commuting students miss out on the possibilities to engage in on campus events or build connections with classmates. A reliable carpooling solution could provide more opportunities for commuting students to build connections. It also offers a safer commuting option, especially for those traveling late at night. Therefore, students need a carpooling service that is affordable, promotes community, and is designed with safety and convenience in mind.

#### High Level Vision
Our platform, CarConnect, addresses the financial and social challenges faced by commuting college students by providing a secure, affordable, and practical carpooling solution. Through CarConnect, students can connect with peers in nearby locations, facilitating organized and reliable shared transportation options. This approach reduces individual transportation costs and supports safer commuting, especially during late hours. CarConnect is dedicated to enhancing accessibility and building a supportive campus community, where students can experience a shared journey that fosters both safety and connection.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Car Sharing / Transportation
- **Mobile:** Primarily a mobile-first platform with a user-friendly phone application designed for easy ride organization and communication.
- **Story:** CarConnect allows college students to organize or join carpools, helping them reduce transportation costs and build connections with peers. It emphasizes affordability, safety, and fostering community by providing a secure way to share rides to campus and back.
- **Market:** Targeted towards off-campus college students who commute to campus regularly. It is particularly appealing to students looking to save on transportation costs, travel safely, and expand their social network by meeting fellow students.
- **Habit:** Students can frequently use the app to organize or join rides daily or weekly, depending on their class schedules. The app encourages regular engagement through features like recurring ride schedules, in-app notifications for ride availability, and incentives for consistent usage (e.g., cost-sharing summaries or badges for frequent carpoolers).
- **Scope:** Initially focused on connecting students for basic campus commutes, the app can expand to include additional features  such as `(out of our scope)`:
  - Real-time ride tracking.
  - Advanced scheduling options for group trips.
  - Integration with campus event schedules for better accessibility to events.
  - Partnerships with universities to provide exclusive perks, such as discounted parking for carpool participants or integration with student IDs.
